# hexagonal


this is another practice of architectures and it is the turn of the hexagonal architecture that is based on domain driven design but this has very different concepts and further isolates the core from the outside
 
It is also known as port and adapter architecture.

# how does it work?

Ports: they are information inputs from the outermost layers to the innermost of our system where the domain and use cases are located, they are not TCP, HTTP or DP sockets but rather abstractions through which information flows from the outer layers to interiors, in some OOP languages ​​such as Java it is represented as interfaces
